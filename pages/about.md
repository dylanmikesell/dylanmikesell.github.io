<!-- ## Overview -->

I am scientific researcher at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) in Oslo, Norway. I sit in a group called Remote Sensing and Geophysics within the Natural Hazards Division at NGI. Prior to NGI, I was a professor in the Department of Geosciences at Boise State University. I am an applied geophysicists by education and training, with 20 years of experience focusing on seismic methods for the imaging and monitoring of Earth's near-surface. I am interested in a number of other geophysical things, which you can read about on my [Research]({{ '/research/' | relative_url }}) page.

## Research Philosophy

My approach to research and teaching emphasizes:

- **Innovation in Methodology**: Developing new approaches and technology that push the boundaries of what we can learn from geophysical data
- **Practical Applications**: Ensuring research contributions address real-world problems in environmental monitoring, hazard assessment, the energy transition, and space resources
- **Collaborative Science**: Working across disciplinary boundaries to tackle complex Earth and Planetary system problems
- **Open Science**: Promoting reproducible research through open-source software development and data sharing
- **Student Mentoring**: Training the next generation of geoscientists and engineers through hands-on research experiences -- in the lab, at the computer, or in the field

## Professional Contributions

**Research Impact**  
My work has contributed to advances in seismic interferometry methods, environmental monitoring applications, and geophysics analysis tools. Research findings have been published in leading geophysics journals and presented at international conferences. You can learn more about this on my [Publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}) page.

**Teaching and Mentoring**  
I am still committed to excellence in undergraduate and graduate education, developing innovative curricula that prepare students for careers in applied geophysics and geospatial data analysis. I still actively mentor graduate students conducting research around the world. You can [contact me]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}) if you are interested in working together.

**Service to the Community**  
I contribute to the scientific community through peer review, conference organization, and professional society activities. I am committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in the geosciences and supporting early-career researchers.

## Professional Memberships and Activities

- American Geophysical Union (AGU)
- Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG)  
- Seismological Society of America (SSA)
