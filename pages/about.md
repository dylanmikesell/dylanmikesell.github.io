## Research Overview

My research focuses on developing new ways to listen to the Earth and create images of the world beneath our feet. Using techniques similar to a medical ultrasound, I analyze sound and seismic waves to understand the processes that shape our planet. This work has a wide range of applications, from monitoring natural hazards like earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides, to tracking the health of glaciers and ice sheets. By interpreting these subtle vibrations, my research helps us better understand environmental changes, improve the safety of critical infrastructure like dams, and even develop new methods for exploring other planets like the Moon and Mars.

### Core Research Areas

**Cryosphere Sciences**

My work in the cryosphere involves listening to the subtle sounds of glaciers and ice sheets to understand their health and behavior. Just as a doctor uses a stethoscope, we use seismic sensors to monitor the vibrations caused by ice cracking, water flowing beneath glaciers, and the massive shifts that lead to calving events or surges. This research helps us track how these critical parts of our climate system are responding to a warming world. We also develop new non-invasive techniques, like using lasers to perform "ultrasounds" on ice cores, which allows us to read the history of past climates trapped within the ice without damaging the samples.

**Solid Earth Sciences**

In solid earth sciences, my focus is on understanding the dynamic processes that lead to natural hazards. By analyzing seismic waves from earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides, we can create detailed images of the Earth's crust and pinpoint the sources of these events. This work is akin to geological CAT scanning, where we use the planet's own vibrations to map out faults, magma chambers, and unstable slopes. The goal is to better understand the physics behind these phenomena to improve our ability to assess risks and contribute to safer communities.

**Atmospheric and Space Sciences**

My research also extends upwards into the highest reaches of our atmosphere. Major events on the ground—such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis—send powerful waves of pressure and sound not just through the ground, but also up into the ionosphere, the electrically charged upper layer of our atmosphere. By using GPS and other satellite signals, we can detect the ripples these events cause hundreds of kilometers above the surface. Studying these atmospheric disturbances provides a unique, sky-high vantage point to observe and understand the scale and power of events on Earth.

**Planetary Sciences**

The same geophysical tools we use to study Earth can be adapted to explore other worlds. My work in planetary science focuses on preparing for future human and robotic exploration of the Moon and Mars. By studying "lunar simulants" — materials that mimic the properties of moon dust and rock — in the lab, we can test how seismic waves travel through them. This helps us design better instruments and methods for rovers and landers to safely characterize the ground they land on, understand the subsurface, and assess the resources available for future off-world habitats.

**Data Analysis and Imaging Methods**

Underpinning all of these areas is a focus on developing innovative methods to analyze complex data. Geophysical data is often messy, filled with background noise and overlapping signals. My research involves creating new computational and mathematical tools to cut through this noise and extract clear information. This includes work in pioneering fields like "seismic interferometry," which turns ambient, background vibrations (from sources like ocean waves) into a powerful signal we can use to create images of the subsurface. By developing smarter algorithms and leveraging machine learning, we can turn raw data into high-resolution insights about our planet and beyond.
