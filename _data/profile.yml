# Bio Summary (Professional Overview)
bio_summary: |
  I am a research geophysicist specializing in seismic wave propagation, 
  ambient noise analysis, and geophysical signal processing. My past research has focused on 
  developing innovative methods to monitor subsurface changes using continuous 
  seismic recordings and advanced signal processing techniques.
  
  I am currently a research scientist at Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), where 
  my work bridges from fundamental seismology to practical applications in environmental
  monitoring and subsurface characterization. I am currently focusing on improving near-surface 
  seismic methods for geotechnical and environmental applications, as well as investigations into
  space resource utilization and signals in Earth's ionosphere from seismic sources at Earth's surface.

  Dr. Mikesell's research program focuses on extracting maximum information from seismic 
  recordings to understand Earth's structure and monitor temporal changes. His work spans 
  from developing theoretical frameworks for seismic interferometry to deploying field 
  experiments for volcano monitoring and environmental seismology applications.
  
  His innovative approaches to ambient noise analysis have contributed to advances in 
  subsurface imaging and monitoring capabilities. Dylan is particularly interested in 
  the application of machine learning techniques to geophysical data analysis and the 
  development of real-time monitoring systems for natural hazards.
