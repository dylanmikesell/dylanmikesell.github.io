# Research & Technical Decisions: Professional Website

**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Feature**: Professional Website  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical clarifications and establish implementation approach

## Research Tasks

### 1. SciXplorer API Client Library

**Decision**: Use vanilla JavaScript fetch API with custom wrapper  
**Rationale**: 
- SciXplorer API is RESTful and well-documented
- Avoid external dependencies (constitutional principle)
- Jekyll + vanilla JS provides sufficient capability
- Custom wrapper allows error handling and caching

**Alternatives considered**:
- Axios library (rejected: unnecessary dependency)
- Jekyll plugins (rejected: GitHub Pages limitations)
- Server-side proxy (rejected: complexity violation)

### 2. API Response Caching Strategy  

**Decision**: Browser localStorage with 24-hour TTL + build-time caching  
**Rationale**:
- Meets constitutional performance requirements
- Reduces API calls and improves reliability
- Browser storage works offline
- Build-time cache provides fallback content

**Implementation approach**:
- Store API responses in localStorage with timestamp
- Jekyll build process fetches and caches content as fallback
- Progressive enhancement: static content â†’ dynamic updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Service Worker caching (rejected: complexity for minimal benefit)
- Only client-side caching (rejected: no offline fallback)
- Only build-time caching (rejected: stale data risk)

### 3. Testing Framework Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach  
**Components**:
- **HTML validation**: W3C validator in CI/CD
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated performance/accessibility auditing  
- **Accessibility testing**: axe-core + manual testing
- **Cross-browser**: BrowserStack or GitHub Actions matrix

**Rationale**: Constitutional requirements demand rigorous testing for performance, accessibility, and browser compatibility

### 4. API Authentication Security Model

**Decision**: GitHub Actions secrets + environment variables  
**Rationale**:
- Keeps API keys secure and out of repository
- GitHub Pages supports environment variable injection
- Meets constitutional security requirements
- Simple deployment workflow

**Implementation**:
- Store SciXplorer API key in GitHub repository secrets
- Jekyll build process accesses via ENV variables
- Client-side JavaScript uses pre-built API responses
- No API keys exposed to browser

### 5. Expected Publication Count & Performance Impact

**Decision**: Optimize for 100+ publications with pagination/filtering  
**Rationale**:
- Academic researchers typically have 20-200 publications
- Plan for growth and performance
- Implement pagination to maintain <3s load time
- Search/filter capabilities for user experience

**Performance strategy**:
- Load first 20 publications immediately
- Lazy load additional content
- Search/filter functionality for large lists
- Responsive images for publication thumbnails

### 6. API Response Caching Duration

**Decision**: 24-hour cache with manual refresh option  
**Rationale**:
- Publications don't change frequently
- Citation metrics update daily at most  
- Balances freshness with performance
- Manual refresh for immediate updates when needed

**Implementation**:
- Check cache timestamp on page load
- Refresh if >24 hours old
- "Refresh" button for manual updates
- Loading states during API calls

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Jekyll Configuration
- Use GitHub Pages supported plugins only
- Implement responsive design with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Progressive enhancement for JavaScript features
- SEO optimization with proper meta tags

### API Integration Pattern
- Fetch API with async/await
- Error boundary handling for API failures
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Graceful degradation to static content

### Performance Optimization
- Critical CSS inlining
- Image optimization with responsive sizes
- Font loading optimization
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size

### Accessibility Implementation
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support

## Risk Mitigation

### SciXplorer API Reliability
- **Risk**: API downtime affects site functionality
- **Mitigation**: Static fallback content, error messaging, manual override capability

### GitHub Pages Limitations
- **Risk**: Limited server-side processing
- **Mitigation**: Client-side processing, build-time API integration, static fallbacks

### Performance with Dynamic Content
- **Risk**: API calls slow down initial load
- **Mitigation**: Caching strategy, lazy loading, progressive enhancement

### Security of API Credentials
- **Risk**: Exposed API keys
- **Mitigation**: Build-time processing, environment variables, no client-side keys

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items have been resolved with specific technical decisions that align with constitutional principles.
