Welcome to my professional research website. I am a research geophysicist specializing in seismic wave propagation, ambient noise analysis, and innovative signal processing methods for understanding Earth's dynamic processes.

## Current Research Focus

My research program centers on extracting maximum information from seismic recordings to advance our understanding of subsurface structure and monitor temporal changes. Key areas include:

- **Seismic Interferometry**: Developing novel methods for ambient noise analysis and virtual source generation
- **Environmental Seismology**: Monitoring subsurface changes for environmental and hazard assessment applications  
- **Volcano Seismology**: Advancing volcanic monitoring through innovative seismic analysis techniques
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Applying computational intelligence to geophysical data interpretation

## Research Opportunities

I actively collaborate with students and researchers on computational geophysics projects. If you're interested in:

- Graduate research in environmental seismology or computational geophysics
- Collaborative research projects in seismic analysis methods
- Postdoctoral opportunities in geophysical signal processing

Please [contact me]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}) to discuss potential opportunities.
