Welcome to my professional website. I am a research geophysicist specializing in seismic wave propagation, ambient noise analysis, and innovative signal processing methods for understanding Earth's dynamic processes.

## Current Research Focus

My research centers on extracting maximum information from geophysical recordings to advance our understanding of Earth systems and monitor temporal changes. Key areas include:

- **Seismic Interferometry**: Developing novel methods for ambient noise analysis and virtual source generation
- **Environmental Seismology**: Monitoring subsurface changes for environmental and hazard assessment applications  
- **Ionosphere Seismology**: Advancing natural hazard monitoring (e.g., tsunami) through innovative data analysis techniques
- **Planetary Surfaces**: Understanding how their soils behave and what that means for future exploration missions

## Research Collaboration

I actively collaborate with students and researchers on a variety of Earth and Planetary science projects. If you're interested in any of the items below then please [contact me]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}) to discuss potential opportunities.

- near-surface seismic imaging and monitoring
- environmental seismology or cryoseismology
- seismic interferometry
- ionospheric seismology
- geophysics and geotechnics on the moon
